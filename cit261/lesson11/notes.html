        <h1> Form Validation</h1>
        <p>When you enter data, the web application checks it to see that the data is correct.
            If the information is correct, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually)
            saved in a database;
            if the information isn't correct, it gives you an error message explaining what needs to be corrected.</p>

        <h2> Different types of form validation</h2>

        <h3>Client-side validation</h3>
        <p> is validation that occurs in the browser before the data has been submitted to the server. Client-side
            validation is more user-friendly than server-side validation because it gives an instant response.
            Client-side validation is further subdivided into the following categories: <br>
            JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable.<br>
            Built-in form validation uses HTML5 form validation features. This validation generally doesn't require
            JavaScript. Built-in form validation has better performance than, but is not as customizable as, JavaScript.
        </p>

        <h3> Server-side validation</h3>
        <p>occurs on the server after the data has been submitted. Server-side code is used to validate the data before
            the data is saved in the database. If the data fails authentication, a response is sent back to the client
            with corrections that the user needs to make.
            Server-side validation is not as user-friendly as client-side validation because it doesn't provide errors
            until the entire form has been submitted.
            However, server-side validation is your application's last line of defense against incorrect or malicious
            data.</p>


        <h1>Using built-in form validation </h1>
        <p>Validation attributes allow you to specify rules for a form input, such as whether a value must be filled in;
            the minimum and maximum length of the data; whether the data needs to be a number, an email address, or
            something else; and a pattern that the data must match.
            If the entered data follows all of the specified rules, it is considered valid; if not, it is considered
            invalid.</p>
