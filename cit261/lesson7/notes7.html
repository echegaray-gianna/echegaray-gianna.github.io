 <h1>ASYNCHRONICITY</h1>
 <p> In a synchronous programming model, things happen one at a time. 
     When you call a function that performs a long-running action, it returns only
      when the action has finished and it can return the result.</p>


 <p>An asynchronous model allows multiple things to happen at the same time. 
     When you start an action, your program continues to run. 
     When the action finishes, the program is informed and gets access to the result </p>

 <p>The solution to this problem, in a synchronous system, is to start additional threads of control. 
     A thread is another running program whose execution may be interleaved with other programs by the operating
    system—since most modern computers contain multiple processors, multiple threads may even run at the same time, 
    on different processors. </p>

 <h2> CALLBACKS</h2>
 <p> One approach to asynchronous programming is to make functions that perform a slow action take an extra argument, a callback function. 
     The action is started, and when it finishes, the callback function is called with the result.
    For example the setTimeout function </p>

 <p>Most crow nest computers have a long-term data storage bulb, where pieces of information are etched into twigs so that they can be retrieved later. 
     Etching, or finding a piece of data, takes a moment, so the interface to long-term storage is asynchronous and uses callback functions.</p>   

<p>Crow nest computers are built to communicate using request-response pairs. That means one nest sends a message to another nest,
   which then immediately sends a message back, confirming receipt and possibly including a reply to a question asked in the message.</p>

<p>The interface exported by the "./crow-tech" module provides callback-based functions for communication. Nests have a send method that sends off a request. 
    It expects the name of the target nest, the type of the request, and the content of the request as its first three arguments, 
    and it expects a function to call when a response comes in as its fourth and last argument.</p>


<p>bigOak.send("Cow Pasture", "note", "Let's caw loudly at 7PM",
        () => console.log("Note delivered."));</p>


<p>But to make nests capable of receiving that request, we first have to define a request type named "note".</p>

   <p>import {defineRequestType} from "./crow-tech";
        defineRequestType("note", (nest, content, source, done) => {
            console.log(`${nest.name} received note: ${content}`);
            done();
          });
    </p>

<p>The defineRequestType function defines a new type of request.
 The example adds support for "note" requests, which just sends a note to a given nest. Our implementation calls console.log so that we can verify that the request arrived. 
 Nests have a name property that holds their name.
 The fourth argument given to the handler, done, is a callback function that it must call when it is done with the request.
</p>

<h2>PROMISES</h2>
<p>A promise is an asynchronous action that may complete at some point and produce a value. It is able to notify anyone who is interested when its value is available.</p>
<p>The easiest way to create a promise is by calling Promise.resolve.
   To get the result of a promise, you can use its then method. This registers a callback function to be called when the promise resolves and produces a value. </p>

<h2>FAILURE</h2>

<p>A widely used convention is that the first argument to the callback is used to indicate that the action failed,
   and the second contains the value produced by the action when it was successful.</p>
 <p>Promises make this easier. They can be either resolved (the action finished successfully) or rejected (it failed). 
     Resolve handlers (as registered with then) are called only when the action is successful, and rejections are automatically 
     propagated to the new promise that is returned by then. </p>

<p>Much like resolving a promise provides a value, rejecting one also provides one, usually called the reason of the rejection.
    To explicitly handle such rejections, promises have a catch method that registers a handler to be called when the promise is 
    rejected, similar to how then handlers handle normal resolution. It’s also very much like then in that it returns a new promise, 
    which resolves to the original promise’s value if it resolves normally and to the result of the catch handler otherwise.
     If a catch handler throws an error, the new promise is also rejected.</p>

<h2>Collections of promises</h2>>

<p>Each nest computer keeps an array of other nests within transmission distance in its neighbors property. To check which of those are currently reachable, you could write a function that tries to send a "ping" request 
    (a request that simply asks for a response) to each of them and see which ones come back</p>
<p>When a neighbor isn’t available, we don’t want the entire combined promise to fail since then we still wouldn’t know anything. So the function that is mapped over the set of neighbors to turn them into request promises
     attaches handlers that make successful requests produce true and rejected ones produce false.</p>


<h2>Async Functions</h2>

<p>To store important information, crows are known to duplicate it across nests. That way, when a hawk destroys a nest, the information isn’t lost.</p>
<p>An async function is marked by the word async before the function keyword. Methods can also be made async by writing async before their name. When such a function or method is called, it returns a promise. 
    As soon as the body returns something, that promise is resolved. If it throws an exception, the promise is rejected.</p>
<p>Inside an async function, the word await can be put in front of an expression to wait for a promise to resolve and only then continue the execution of the function.
   Such a function no longer, like a regular JavaScript function, runs from start to completion in one go. Instead, it can be frozen at any point that has an await, and can be resumed at a later time.</p>


   <h2>Generators</h2>
<p>This ability of functions to be paused and then resumed again is not exclusive to async functions. JavaScript also has a feature called generator functions. These are similar, but without the promises.</p>
<p>Initially, when you call powers, the function is frozen at its start. Every time you call next on the iterator, the function runs until it hits a yield expression, which pauses it and causes the yielded value to become the next value produced by the iterator. 
    When the function returns (the one in the example never does), the iterator is done.</p>

<h1>HTTP AND FORMS</h1>

<p>The information sent by the client is called the request. It starts with this line:

        GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1
        The first word is the method of the request. 
        GET means that we want to get the specified resource. Other common methods are 
        DELETE to delete a resource, 
        PUT to create or replace it, and 
        POST to send information to it</p>

<p>The part after the method name is the path of the resource the request applies to. After the resource path, the first line of the request mentions HTTP/1.1 to indicate the version of the HTTP protocol it is using.</p>

<p>The server’s response will start with a version as well, followed by the status of the response, first as a three-digit status code and then as a human-readable string.

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK</p>

<p>Status codes starting with a 2 indicate that the request succeeded. Codes starting with 4 mean there was something wrong with the request.
  Codes that start with 5 mean an error happened on the server and the request is not to blame.</p>


<p>The first line of a request or response may be followed by any number of headers. These are lines in the form name: value that specify extra information about the request or response.
        After the headers, both requests and responses may include a blank line followed by a body, which contains the data being sent. GET and DELETE requests don’t send along any data, but PUT and POST requests do. </p>


<h2>Fetch</h2>

<p>The interface through which browser JavaScript can make HTTP requests is called fetch</p>
<p>Calling fetch returns a promise that resolves to a Response object holding information about the server’s response, such as its status code and its headers. The headers are wrapped in a Map-like object that treats its keys (the header names) as case insensitive because header names are not supposed to be case sensitive. 
    This means headers.get("Content-Type") and headers.get("content-TYPE") will return the same value.</p>
