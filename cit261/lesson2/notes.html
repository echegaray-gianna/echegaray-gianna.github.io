     const square = function(x) { // a funtion start with "funtion" expresion"  Functions have a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body
     return x * x;
     };

     console.log(square(12));
    // → 144

    const makeNoise = function() {
    console.log("Pling!");
     };

    makeNoise();
    // → Pling!

    const power = function(base, exponent) {
     let result = 1;
    for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
    result *= base;
     }
     return result;
     };

    console.log(power(2, 10));
    // → 1024

DECLARATION NOTATION --- 
                There is a slightly shorter way to create a function binding. When the function keyword is used at the start of a statement, it works differently.
                function square(x) {
                    return x * x;
                  }
ARROW FUNTIONS ---
                There’s a third notation for functions, which looks very different from the others. Instead of the function keyword, it uses an arrow (=>) made up of an equal sign and a greater-than character 
                const power = (base, exponent) => {
                    let result = 1;
                    for (let count = 0; count < exponent; count++) {
                      result *= base;
                    }
                    return result;
                  };
